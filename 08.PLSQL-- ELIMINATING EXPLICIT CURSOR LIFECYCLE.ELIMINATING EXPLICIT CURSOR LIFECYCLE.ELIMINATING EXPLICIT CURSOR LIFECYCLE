ELIMINATING EXPLICIT CURSOR LIFECYCLE;

Using Cursor For Loop We Are Eliminating Explicit Cursor Lifecycle.
When We Are Using Cursor For Loop Internally Pl/Sql Engine Uses Open ,Fetch, Close Statements .

CURSOR FOR LOOP:





SYNTAX:

FOR INDEX_VARIABLE IN CURSOR_NAME
    LOOP
          STATEMENTS
    END LOOP;

This Is Also Called As Shortcut Method Of The Cursor .

EXAMPLE:

DECLARE
    CURSOR C1 IS SELECT ENAME,SAL FROM EMP ;
BEGIN
    FOR I IN C1 LOOP
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(I.ENAME|| ' ' ||I.SAL);
    END LOOP;
END ;
/
We Can Also Eliminate The Declare Section Of The Cursor Using For Loop In The Case We Are Using The Select Statements In Place Of Cursor_Name In The Cursor For Loop
EXAMPLE:

BEGIN
    FOR I IN (SELECT * FROM EMP) LOOP
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(I.ENAME|| ' ' ||I.SAL);
     END LOOP;
END ;
