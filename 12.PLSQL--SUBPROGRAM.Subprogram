Subprogram in PL/SQL

A subprogram in PL/SQL is a named block of code that performs a specific task.
It helps to organize and reuse code instead of repeating the same logic again and again.

âœ… Key Points:
Subprograms are named PL/SQL blocks.
They are stored in the database and can be called whenever needed.
Useful for modular programming (divide big programs into smaller tasks).
Can accept parameters and return output.

Types of Subprograms:

   1) Procedure ---Performs a task. May or may not return a value.
   2) Function ----Always returns a single value. Used in expressions.
